Today's challenge is making an Employee Salary Analysis System with Student Identification. I had analysed the challenge and that I had to make two interfaces for the challenge.
One screen to input my name, roll number and the no of employees with their salaries and a second screen to ask the user to check the lowest salary, highest salary etc. 
So I had first declared my variables and then started giving user inputs for all of the specified fields. I then realised that I needed to reject the entries of employees above 10 so I had done that.
Then I moved on to asking the salary of each employee using loops. Then had formatted the second screen to ask the user about the salary details, using if else commands.
At the end I had given my name and roll number and had wrapped today's challenge.
