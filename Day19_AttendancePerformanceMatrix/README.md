Today's challenge is making a Student Attendance and Performance Analysis Matrix.
We have to take the input of 5 students regarding their attendance of each subject and marks of each subject as well. In total there are 5 subjects.
At the end we should ask the user in a menu for their input for either showing the Attendance matrix, marks matrix, attendance report, performance report or grade report.
We should also find the lowest scorer, highest scorer, find the average marks of each students and finally find the grade of each student.
