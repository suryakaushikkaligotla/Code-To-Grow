Today's challenge is to make a Student Performance analyser using arrays (1D), loops (For, While), conditional Logic, aggregation (Sum, Average, Count), grade distribution analysis.
It analyses the marks of 10 students and using the given marks distribution, determines the grade of a student (A,A++, B, C, D, F). It also finds the class highest and lowest and class average, the number of failed and passed students.
